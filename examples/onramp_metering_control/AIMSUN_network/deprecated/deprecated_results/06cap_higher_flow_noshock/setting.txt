This is a simulation using the setIneqConstraints_noshock.m class (change the OptProgram.m code.) 
where the shock wave intersection points are not added in the constraints.

Setting:
1. Use the higher flow AIMSUN .ang file. 
2. Set work zone capacity as 0.6 of original road capacity, 
which is read from AIMSUN output network configuration file.
3. Set soft queue limit as 300 meters right upstream of the work zone.
4. Set the error as follows:
errors = struct;
errors.e_default = 0.2;
errors.e_his = 0.2; % historical data error
errors.e_est = 0.0; % estimated initial condition error
errors.e_meas_flow = 0.0;
workzone_capacity = 0.6;
max_meter_rate = 900;   % veh/hr
5. Set the initial condition on all links as 0.2*rho_c.
6. Not consider the shock wave intersection points constraints (using the 
setIneqConstraints_noshock.m class)
