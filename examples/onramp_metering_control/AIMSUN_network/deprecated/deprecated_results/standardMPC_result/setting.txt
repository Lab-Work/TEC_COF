1. Use the higher flow AIMSUN .ang file. 
2. workzone_capacity = 0.5 * original road capacity
which is read from AIMSUN output network configuration file.
3. Set softqueue limit as 100 meters right upstream of the work zone.
4. Set the error all as zero
5. As observed in AIMSUN: max_meter_rate = 900;   % veh/hr
6. Historical data is the demand set in AIMSUN. AIMSUN will generate traffic according to the demand but with large variation.
7. Randomly pick a scenario for the MPC.

To avoid possible infeasibility of CP. 
The initial conditions are
link_390(5,1) = 0.2*kc
link_330(5,1) = 0.4*kc
link_329(5,1) = 0.8*kc


Result:
Delay Time: 21.06
Total Travel Time: 126.21
Throughput: 2152
