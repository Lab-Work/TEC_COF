This is a second run of using a different initial condition.
Due to stochastic feature of AIMSUN simulation, this is a slightly different result obtained. 
 
1. Use the higher flow AIMSUN .ang file. 
2. Set work zone capacity as 0.6 of original road capacity, 
which is read from AIMSUN output network configuration file.
3. Set softqueue limit as 300 meters right upstream of the work zone.
4. Set the error as follows:
errors = struct;
errors.e_default = 0.2;
errors.e_his = 0.2; % historical data error
errors.e_est = 0.0; % estimated initial condition error
errors.e_meas_flow = 0.0;
workzone_capacity = 0.6;
max_meter_rate = 900;   % veh/hr
5. Set the initial condition on all links as 0.2*rho_c.
6. Consider the shock wave intersection points constraitns (using the 
OptProgram.m class)


Result:
delay time: 19.62 (sec/km)
total travel time: 123.65,
workzone throughput: 2145
