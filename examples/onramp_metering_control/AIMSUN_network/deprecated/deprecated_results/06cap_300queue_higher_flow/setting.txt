1. Use the higher flow AIMSUN .ang file. 
2. Set work zone capacity as 0.6 of original road capacity, 
which is read from AIMSUN output network configuration file.
3. Set softqueue limit as 300 meters right upstream of the work zone.
4. Set the error as follows:
errors = struct;
errors.e_default = 0.2;
errors.e_his = 0.2; % historical data error
errors.e_est = 0.0; % estimated initial condition error
errors.e_meas_flow = 0.0;
workzone_capacity = 0.6;
max_meter_rate = 900;   % veh/hr

5. Consider the shock wave intersection points constraitns (using the 
OptProgram.m class)
